# Fynd Assessment — Repository Overview

This repository bundles both tasks from the assessment:

- Task 1: Prompt engineering and evaluation (notebook + helper scripts).
- Task 2: Django app that provides a feedback dashboard and uses an LLM to summarize reviews.

Included content

- `task1_rating_prompting.ipynb` — Notebook for Task 1.
- `task1_scripts/` — Helper scripts for Task 1 (`prompts.py`, `llm_client.py`, `utils.py`, `evaluate_prompts.py`).
- `data/sample_yelp_200.csv` — Sample data used in Task 1.
- `fynd_task2/` — Django project (app `feedback`) for Task 2.
- `.env.example` and `.env` — Environment variable templates and local placeholder (do NOT commit real secrets).
- `PROJECT_README.md` — this file.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` — instructions and placeholders to add deployment links.

Deployment links (replace placeholders in `PROJECT_README.md` and `DEPLOYMENT.md`):

- Task 1 Notebook (hosted): <YOUR_TASK1_NOTEBOOK_DEPLOY_URL>
- Task 2 Django Dashboard: <YOUR_TASK2_DASHBOARD_URL>

If you want, I can help deploy both dashboards and populate the links here.
